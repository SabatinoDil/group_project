           <p class="nab">North America has three species of bears, the American bear <em>(Ursus americanus)</em>, the grizzly or brown bear 
           <em>(Ursus arctos)</em>, and the polar bear <em>(Ursus maritimus)</em>. They use a different range of distribution front the lowest states as do the black bear to the artic habitats where the polar bear live. They have a wide range of food resources from vegetables founded over the forest to the fish in the coolest water of the Arctic. Their behavior and answer to human contact depends of the way that they can see a human threaten them, so in mostly cases it is better to avoid them even if they are close to a human environments. Two of the North American especies are not listed with any risk by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list but polar bears do, they are Vulnerable due to a climate change.</p>

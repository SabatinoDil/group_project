      <p class="nab">The polar is maybe one of the most emblematic bears of all, they live in the remote Artic habitat, where human development are lacking due to a difficult climate conditions there. They retains more of its original habitat than any other large carnivore found nowadays. Polar bears live in Alaska but also are distributed in the north part of Canada. The Red List of IUCN has listed this specie with a status of Vulnerable because they are threatened by different types of risk, like climate change, habitat lost and population decreasing, facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. Because the polar bear spends many months of the year at sea is catalogue as a marine mammal, although they are able to cover miles on foot and run of land. Preference for Artic inter-island archipielagos and over continental shelf are the ones that polar bears are choosing to stay because of the highest biological productivity compared with the deep water of the high Arctic. Being a not territorial bear is one of the characteristics that distinguish this specie, they often choose to escape rather than fight between one another. They are rarely seem attacking humans but a hungry polar bear could be a extremely umpredictable, been reported at killing and sometimes eating humans. Polar bears do sometimes communicate with various sounds and vocalizations. Between April and May take place the courtship and mating in polar bears, they congregate in the best seal hunting areas, because they guaranted food resources to keep the breeding process. They are a polygynous mating system. Once the female bear is pregnant they gained at least 200 kg doubling often her body weight. Life expectancy rarely goes beyond 25 years, reporting a record die at age of 32, and a female bear who died at age of 43.

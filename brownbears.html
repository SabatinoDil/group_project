The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists this specie of bear at Least Concern because of their stable number population across the United States. Due to a loss of 98% of its original habitat in the lower 48 states the brown bear has shrinking in the total number of individuals but still keep a population stable across Alaska and gradually but steadily along the Rockies and the eastern Great Plains. Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has the largest population of brown bears in the lower 48 states. Brown bears prefers open to semi-open landscapes like the ones found in Great Plains, tundra, coastal estuaries, islands prairie, and Rockies Mountains. Behavior in this specie is often associated with nocturnal activity for foraging; however they can do that in an early morning or early evening. Mostly solitary specie of bear who can gather in large numbers when they find major big sources. The brown bear is a serially monogamous bear, remaining with the same mate from a couple of days to a couple of weeks, even though they will try to mate with as many female as they can, similar behavior is seem from a female to male during the breeding period. Brown bear females have a peak reproductively age that ranges from 4 to 20 years old, and their lifespan in both sexes in areas minimally hunted is estimated at an average of 25 years. In captivity were recorded males live up to 47 years.
